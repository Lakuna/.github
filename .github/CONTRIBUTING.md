# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to my project. Please navigate to the header for the type of contribution you plan on making for further details.

## Testing and bug reports

Before filing a bug report, please look through existing open bug reports to ensure that you aren't filing a duplicate. If an identical or similar bug report already exists, it would be helpful if you would leave a comment on that report with as many of the following fields as applicable and possible:

- The operating system and its version on the device on which the bug occurred.
- The version of the software in which the bug occurred.
- For web-based projects, the browser and its version on which the bug occurred.
- For modifications of other software, the version of the parent software on which the bug occurred.
- Steps to reproduce the bug, especially if missing from the original report.
- Images of the bug, if applicable.
- Any other relevant details.

If no similar bug report exists, please fill out the relevant bug report form that is included in the repository.

## Submitting changes and pull requests

Please try to limit the scope of each pull request to one issue or a small related group of issues in order to make the code easier to review. Make sure to tag each issue that the pull request addresses in the commit messages so that they can be closed once the request has been merged.

I'm not picky regarding the style of submitted code. If code style matters for a repository, a task will be set up to automatically reformat submitted code.
